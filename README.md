# Prime Video Dashboard

This project is an interactive **Prime Video Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. The dashboard is designed to analyze streaming data, user engagement, content performance, and key metrics for the Prime Video platform. The visualizations provide actionable insights into user behavior and content trends, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.

## Features

### 1. **Content Performance Analysis**
- Insights into top-performing movies and TV shows based on user engagement metrics such as total views, watch time, and user ratings.
- Visualizations ranking top content by genre, release date, and viewer demographics.
- Comparison of original Prime content versus licensed content, with viewership trends over time.

### 2. **User Engagement Trends**
- Tracks user engagement, including watch time per user, active users over time, and average session duration.
- Identifies user preferences for content genres, categories, and specific features (e.g., subtitles, 4K viewing).
- Analyzes binge-watching patterns, frequent rewatching, and seasonal spikes in viewership.

### 3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- Tracks important metrics like total hours streamed, active users, average ratings, and user growth over specific periods.
- High-level snapshots of platform health, audience engagement, and content success.
- Additional KPIs include subscriber growth, churn rates, and average revenue per user (ARPU).

### 4. **Visualizations**
- Line charts for viewing trends, bar charts for content performance, pie charts for market share analysis, and stacked charts for complex variable relationships.
- Drill-down functionality to break down aggregate data into finer details (e.g., regions or time intervals).
- Dynamic and interactive visuals with customizable filters for specific data views.

### 5. **Filter Options**
- Interactive slicers and filters for custom data exploration by time period, content category, genre, region, and viewer type.
- Cross-filtering capabilities to explore relationships between data points.
- Responsive visualizations that dynamically adjust based on applied filters.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **Power BI**
- **Power BI** is the primary tool used for building and designing the dashboard. It offers interactive visualizations and a robust platform for exploring large datasets.
- Power BI's **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** is used for complex calculations like rolling averages, growth rates, and custom KPIs.
- Power BIâ€™s **data modeling** features enable efficient transformations and merging of various datasets for unified analysis.

### 2. **Excel/CSV Data**
- **Excel** or **CSV** files were used as primary data sources containing viewership data, content performance metrics, user demographics, and other relevant datasets.
- The data was cleaned, transformed, and loaded into Power BI for analysis. The use of Excel/CSV allows for easy updates and reloading of data.

### 3. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- Extensively used for custom calculations and measures within Power BI.
- Examples include custom time intelligence functions, content popularity rankings, and user retention metrics.
- Enables dynamic metrics that update based on user interactions with the dashboard.

### 4. **Data Modeling & Transformation**
- Merging, cleaning, and transforming data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- Utilizes Power BI's advanced features for data management and transformation, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

## Future Expansions
- The project can be expanded to connect to live data sources or integrate with databases for real-time updates.
- Further KPIs and advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling, could be implemented for more robust decision-making.
